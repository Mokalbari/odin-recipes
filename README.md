This is the setup for the HTML Project : "recipes".
odin-recipes is cloned from Github git@github.com:Mokalbari/odin-recipes.git

The goal of this project is to master the basics of HTML.
I will have to write an entire website first only using HTML.
The website will contain several pages with images, links, and hypertext references.
